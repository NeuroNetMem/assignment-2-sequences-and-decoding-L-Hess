# Assignment 2, spiking sequences and decoding. 

In this assignment we will look at techniques for spike train decoding, that is the "reading of neural code". 

The assignment is written as a Matlab livescript, which is roughly comparable to a Jupyter Python notebook. If you need a Matlab installation, please see the instructions posted on Brightspace. 

The Livescript contains links to key references that provide a good introduction to the science behind these methods.
